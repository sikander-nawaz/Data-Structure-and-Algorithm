# You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
# Return the single element that appears only once.
# Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
# Output: 2

# SOLUTION:

class Solution:
    def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            
            # Ensure mid is even
            if mid % 2 == 1:
                mid -= 1
            
            # Check the pair starting at mid
            if nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]:
                left = mid + 2
            else:
                right = mid
        
        return nums[left]
